FEATURES:
- maybe use placeInfoBatch (1 big half-hour availability json for all dates, all courts)
    - use it for quick-scan, i.e. to see which days are fully booked
- use timeInfoBatch for crawling
    - use to check there are free courts of desired time (e.g. 19:00 weekdays or 17:00 weekends)
    - if we have ExtensionInterest, see if there is a new court with desired ExtensionInterest (and at least 1 hr time)
    - if not, make a timeInfoBatch call with held courtID and see if there is 30min availability
- cache
    - old cache had
        - half-hour slot array (from 18:00 till 20:00 I think)
        - aggregate reservation data
    - new cache should have
        - booked time (duration?) -- more flexible than half-hour slots
        - booked courtID          -- not aggregate, allows implementing proper extension interest
- extension interest
    - now only 30 mins extension implemented. Do incrementally earler/later extension aattempts (with floor/ceiling)
        - actually, a gradually degradding favorable thing should be attempted. Floor/ceiling is necessary (for weekday and weekend)
        - but also priority list e.g. I'll do 18:00 if I need to but I'd rather change court/venue to make it 18:30

- ability to have arbitrary from-to time bracket (like we have EARLY_BIRD, LATE_OWL) for weekdays and for weekends (or for any weekday, or even for specific Desire?)
- for <48-hour purchase-only (vs. reserve with ability to cancel) cases. Sometimes they are 90-min- or 120-min- only, because seller decided to not sell in pieces.
     In these cases need to attempt to make 60-, 90-, and 120- minute requests, because they will not appear in 60-min aviable durations

- stdo --> logger
    - migration to logger
    - debugMode migration to logger level
    - log "searching for reservation" with higher level
    - log REST logs with lower elvel

- first:
    - add cap for weekends. I don't want my 16:30 LATER desire to yield 18:30 suggestions
    - clay courts that have priority: courts 1, 5 most in the shade have priority. next, courts 2, 6 have priority because they're next-best courts in shade, etc.
